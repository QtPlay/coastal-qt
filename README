This package is being developed as a series of generic and fully cross-platform
usable QT desktop applications.  Most interface work is done directly in QT
Designer.

Qfind is intended to become a QT version of "catfish", although the ui suggests
it may end up with substantially more functionality for selecting, searching,
and using groups of files than catfish originally had.  Qman is a QT version of
"gman" and will likely make use of man2html as a backend engine.  Other things,
like qscope, will also be added over time.
