Likely issues to remain at initial release:

Dialog
	Lots of zenity and dialog features and synonyms to add

Manpager

	Viewer rendering still too limited a subset of nroff for some pages

	Viewer could add hyperlink support for urls and internal links for
	page references

Notify
	Chat view sizes, etc, should be calculated at construction time once

	Options enabled

	Hyperlinks highlighted

	Right-click context menus, user stuff, lots of things

Notes
	To be added
